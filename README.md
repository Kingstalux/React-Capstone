# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
. In this task, we were working with the real live data from the SpaceX API. The task was to build a web application for a company that provides commercial and scientific space travel services. The application will allow users to book rockets and join selected space missions. The Rockets section displays a list of all available SpaceX rockets. Users can book each rocket by clicking the reservation button or cancel the previously made booking. The Missions section displays a list of current missions along with their brief description and participation status. There is also a button next to each mission that allows users to join the selected mission or leave the mission the user joined earlier. The My Profile section displays all reserved rockets and space missions.
