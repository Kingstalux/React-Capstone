# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
.The project is a single page application (SPA) built with React and Redux.
The data retrieved from the API is stored in the Redux store and then filtered using a Filter stateless component.
Every page (the home page and the details for each country) has a unique route within the SPA.
The project is deployed using Heroku and is accessible online
